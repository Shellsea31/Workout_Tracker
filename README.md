## Description
During these historical times of a pandemic, it's easy to lose sight of the habits that make us feel the most productive. Exercise and setting goals

Upon opening the app, you will be presented with your most recent workout stats and an option to continue the workout or create a new one. Log as many exercises as you want! Click Dashboard to see a chart of all the weight you carried and the duration of all your workouts from the past week.
